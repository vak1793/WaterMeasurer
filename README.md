# WaterMeasurer

Solution to the water jug problem

Install ruby onto your system from [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) or using [RVM](https://rvm.io/).

Run `ruby app/calculator.rb` for calculator. The calculator will attempt to find the shortest path to the end configuration, if possible. Max runtime of 3 minutes. If no paths were found in 3 minutes, then it means that graph branching is too high.

Install RSpec onto your system using `gem install rspec`

Run specs with this command - `rspec spec --format documentation`
